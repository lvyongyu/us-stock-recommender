# Strategy System Analysis Document

## üìä Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the strategy pattern implementation in the US Stock Recommendation System, covering the working principles of various analysis strategies, weight configurations, and practical application methods.

## üèóÔ∏è Strategy Architecture Design

### Strategy Pattern Implementation
The system adopts the classic Strategy Pattern, encapsulating different stock analysis methods into independent strategy classes, achieving:
- **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**: Each strategy implements analysis logic independently
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new analysis strategies
- **Configurability**: Supports dynamic strategy weight adjustment
- **Fault Tolerance**: Individual strategy failures don't affect overall analysis

### Inheritance Hierarchy

## üìà Detailed Strategy Analysis

### 1. Technical Indicator Strategy (40% Weight)

#### Core Indicator Weight Distribution
| Technical Indicator | Weight | Description |
|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| RSI (Relative Strength Index) | 30% | Identify overbought/oversold conditions |
| MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) | 25% | Identify trend reversal points |
| Moving Averages (SMA) | 25% | Confirm price trend direction |
| Other Technical Indicators | 20% | Auxiliary signal verification |

#### Scoring Logic Details
```python
# RSI Analysis (Max 30 points)
if rsi < 30:          # Oversold zone
    score += 30       # Strong buy signal
elif rsi < 40:        # Weak zone  
    score += 15       # Mild buy signal
elif rsi > 70:        # Overbought zone
    score -= 25       # Sell signal
elif rsi > 60:        # Strong zone
    score -= 10       # Caution signal

# MACD Analysis (Max 25 points)
if macd > signal_line and macd > 0:    # Golden cross above zero
    score += 25                         # Strong buy
elif macd > signal_line:               # Golden cross
    score += 15                         # Buy
elif macd < signal_line and macd < 0:  # Death cross below zero
    score -= 20                         # Sell
```

### 2. Quantitative Strategy (35% Weight)

#### Quantitative Factor Weight Distribution
| Quantitative Factor | Weight | Analysis Dimension |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Price Momentum | 25% | Short to medium-term price trend |
| Volatility | 20% | Market risk assessment |
| Volume | 20% | Market participation and confirmation |
| Price Position | 35% | Relative high/low position |

#### Quantitative Model Details
```python
# Price Momentum Analysis (25 points)
momentum_5d = (price_today - price_5d_ago) / price_5d_ago
momentum_20d = (price_today - price_20d_ago) / price_20d_ago

if momentum_5d > 0.03 and momentum_20d > 0.05:  # Both short and medium term strong
    score += 25
elif momentum_5d > 0.01:                        # Short-term uptrend
    score += 15
elif momentum_5d < -0.03:                       # Short-term downtrend
    score -= 20
```

### 3. AI/ML Strategy (25% Weight)

#### Feature Engineering
The system extracts 7 key features for machine learning models:
```python
features = {
    'price_change_pct': (current_price - prev_price) / prev_price,
    'volume_ratio': current_volume / avg_volume,
    'rsi': rsi_14,
    'macd_histogram': macd - signal_line,
    'volatility': np.std(price_changes_20d),
    'momentum_5d': 5_day_momentum,
    'momentum_20d': 20_day_momentum
}
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Strategy Manager

### Default Weight Configuration
```python
default_weights = {
    'technical': 0.40,      # 40% - Technical Analysis
    'quantitative': 0.35,   # 35% - Quantitative Analysis  
    'aiml': 0.25           # 25% - AI/ML Prediction
}
```

### Combined Scoring Algorithm
```python
# Weighted average calculation
combined_score = Œ£(strategy_score_i √ó weight_i)
combined_confidence = Œ£(strategy_confidence_i √ó weight_i)

# Final decision mapping
if combined_score >= 60:    action = "strong_buy"
elif combined_score >= 25:  action = "buy"  
elif combined_score >= -25: action = "hold"
elif combined_score >= -60: action = "sell"
else:                      action = "strong_sell"
```

## üîß Practical Application Guide

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Basic analysis
python stock_recommender.py AAPL

# Specify strategy combination  
python stock_recommender.py TSLA --strategies technical,quantitative

# Custom weights
python stock_recommender.py MSFT --weights technical:0.5,quantitative:0.3,aiml:0.2
```

### Programming Interface Usage
```python
from src.engines.strategy_manager import StrategyManager
from src.analyzers.stock_analyzer import StockAnalyzer

# Create analyzer and strategy manager
analyzer = StockAnalyzer("AAPL")
manager = StrategyManager()

# Execute combined analysis
result = manager.analyze_combined(analyzer, ['technical', 'quantitative', 'aiml'])

# Parse results
print(f"Recommended Action: {result['action']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}%")  
print(f"Combined Score: {result['score']}")
print(f"Analysis Reasons: {result['reasons']}")
```
